APIviz doclet fork. The main change is JDK 7 support.

This fork is based in the last stable release (1.3.1 GA). The original project can be found at: "code.google.com/p/apiviz":http://code.google.com/p/apiviz.

h1. Plans

A future goal is to allow wiki syntax to API comments. But don't expect to see a lot of improvements here.
